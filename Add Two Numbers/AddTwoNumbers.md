**LeetCode Problem #2 (Medium)** <br />

Given two **non-empty** linked lists representing two non-negative integers. 
The digits are stored in **reverse order**, and each of their nodes contains a single digit.
Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.
<br />
May assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself. <br />

**Constraints** <br />
The number of nodes in each linked list is in the range ```[1, 100]```. <br />
```0 <= Node.val <= 9``` <br />
It is guaranteed that the list represents a number that does not have leading zeros. <br />
